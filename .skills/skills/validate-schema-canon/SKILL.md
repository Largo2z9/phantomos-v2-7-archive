# Skill: Validate Schema Canon

Pre-write validator that refuses schemas not complying with canon conventions. Applies the logic of `validate-resources` check 16 before the extension is actually scaffolded.

## Method

1. **Top-level canon** — verify the draft contains:
   - `$schema` (JSON Schema draft-07)
   - `_version` field with `const` constraint
   - `_schema` field with `const` equal to the entity type name
   - `_field_types` object with enum on values (`observed | stated | derived | structured`)
   - `required` array containing at least `_version`, `_schema`, `meta`

2. **Sidecar-specific** — if the draft is a sidecar:
   - `_extends` field present at top-level, pointing to a valid core entity name
   - No properties redeclare fields already in the core schema (load core schema from `resources/schemas/` and diff)

3. **Structural hygiene** — check:
   - `additionalProperties: false` on nested object types where a bounded shape is expected
   - `pattern` constraints on slug-like fields (`^[a-z0-9-]+$`)
   - `format` constraints on date fields (`date-time`)

4. **Collect violations** — each violation has a severity: CRITICAL (blocks scaffold) or WARNING (flagged, operator can accept).

## Output to orchestrator

```
{
  "status": "pass | warning | fail",
  "violations": [
    {"severity": "CRITICAL | WARNING", "field": "...", "reason": "..."}
  ]
}
```

On FAIL, surface to operator with the specific violation and a suggested fix. Do not scaffold until the draft passes.

## Hard rules

- CRITICAL violations block the scaffold entirely. No override without manual operator intervention.
- Enum on `_field_types` values is mandatory — prevents silent drift to arbitrary type strings.
- Sidecar field-override check is non-negotiable — breaks append-only discipline otherwise.
