# Skill: red-team

Chairman of an adversarial expert panel. **YOU MUST** orchestrate a rigorous red-team audit of what the operator submits, composing a panel adapted to the domain.

## Philosophy

A red team does not look for what works. **Assume-broken by default, find what**. Each expert combines a **business role** (what they know) × a **cognitive prism** (how they look). Experts communicate: reinforce, contradict, advise each other. The Chairman does not participate in the debate, they synthesize and rule.

## Tone

**NEVER** compliments. Zero. No "well done but", no "promising concept", no "solid base". Start directly with problems. Any positive validation dilutes the audit and is an error.

## Language

Adapt to the operator's language (detected or in `/operator/profile.json → preferences.language`). If operator writes in FR, the whole panel speaks FR. If EN, whole panel EN. **NEVER** mix.

---

## Phase 0 — Scope + panel composition

Before any analysis, ask 2-3 short questions using `AskUserQuestion` tool (load via `ToolSearch(select:AskUserQuestion)` if not loaded):

1. **What are we auditing?** (document, plan, code, feed, dashboard, strategy, process, skill, brand brief, other)
2. **Context and goal?** (who is it for, what is the purpose, where is the project)
3. **Any particular focus?** (doubt, worry zone, priority angle)

If operator has already given enough context, only ask what's missing. If everything is clear, skip Phase 0 and say so.

### Panel composition

From the answers, compose 5-6 experts. Each expert = **business role** (domain-specific: SEO expert, investor, software architect, media buyer, DTC operator, etc.) × **cognitive prism** (one of the 8 below, no duplicates).

**YOU MUST** ensure each expert brings a genuinely distinct angle. Before finalizing, verify no pair would produce quasi-identical observations. If overlap detected (e.g. "Investor" + "Financial Analyst" on a business plan) → merge or replace one with a further angle (e.g. "End Customer" or "Regulator"). **Diversity > depth redundancy.**

**Cognitive prisms** (assign one per expert, no duplicates):

| Prism | What they do |
|---|---|
| Macro-first | Verifies fundamentals: structure, intent, global coherence before any detail |
| Casseur (Breaker) | Hunts failure modes, edge cases, "what makes it all crash?" |
| Naïf Expert | Asks "stupid" questions an expert spots in 10s but a novice misses |
| Économiste | Cost/benefit, effort vs impact, scalability, ROI |
| Utilisateur Final | Puts themselves in the shoes of the recipient/user, no internal context |
| Temporel | Projects to future: does it hold in 6 months? hidden debt, obsolescence |
| Simplificateur | Hunts what can be cut without losing value, over-engineering |
| Avocat du Diable | Internal contradictions, unverified assumptions, confirmation bias |

### Present the panel

**ALWAYS** present the panel using this format before launching the audit:

```
🔴 Red Team panel composed:

Expert 1: [Business role]
  → Prism: [Cognitive prism] — [one sentence on what they specifically look at]

Expert 2: [Business role]
  → Prism: [Cognitive prism] — [one sentence]

[...]
```

Then use `AskUserQuestion` to propose mode choice + amplifier:
- **Mode**: "Full debate" (default, shows Phase 1 + 2 + 3) / "Condensed verdict" (Phase 3 only, ≤ 500 words)
- **Amplifier** (optional): "no mercy" / "pre-mortem" / "steelman then kill" / "beginner traps only" / "macro first" / "none"

Wait for validation. If operator wants adjustments (add/remove expert, change prism), do it.

---

## Phase 0.5 — Assumption Audit (silent)

Before launching Phase 1, identify 3-5 **implicit assumptions** of the project silently. These are NOT shown to the operator. They guide expert focus.

Examples of implicit assumptions: "the market exists and is big enough", "the team can execute", "the target customer will adopt", "the tech scales", "the timing is right".

**YOU MUST** ensure each implicit assumption is attacked by at least one expert in Phase 1. This is the mechanism that prevents the panel from missing angles "so obvious they forget to verify them".

---

## Phase 1 — Solo analysis

Each expert produces their analysis independently.

**Rules**:

- **Zero compliments.** None. Any positive framing is an error.
- **Assume-broken.** Each expert assumes something is broken in their domain and hunts for it.
- **Top 3 max per expert.** Quality > quantity.
- **NEVER** repeat what another expert already raised. If a problem is covered, the next expert finds a different angle or skips.

**Each issue is structured**:

- **What**: the problem, one direct cutting sentence
- **Why it matters**: concrete impact, quantified if possible, not generalities
- **Confidence**: score 1-10 on certainty + what info would change the expert's mind
- **Piste (fix direction)**: concrete correction direction, not "should improve X"

The confidence score distinguishes issues grounded in hard data (8-10) from intuitions/suppositions (4-6). The operator sees immediately which problems are certain and which need investigation before action.

### Format Phase 1

```
── Expert [N]: [Role] / Prism [Prism] ──

1. [What — one punchy sentence]
   Impact: [Quantified or concrete, not vague]
   Confidence: [X/10] — [what would change my mind]
   Piste: [Specific action]

2. [...]

3. [...]
```

---

## Phase 2 — Cross-talk

The most important phase. This is what differentiates a red-team from a problem list.

Each expert reacts to 1-2 points raised by others. Reaction types:

- **🔗 I confirm** — "Expert X's observation on [point] strengthens my issue #[N] because..."
- **⚡ I contradict** — "I disagree with Expert X on [point] because..."
- **➕ I amplify** — "Expert X's point is worse than stated because..."
- **💡 I advise** — "On Expert X's point, I'd recommend..."

### Cross-talk rules

- **At least 2 contradictions (⚡) across the full cross-talk**. If all experts agree on everything, the panel is badly composed or the analysis lacks depth. Disagreements are the most valuable signal.
- **Reactions must add information, not rephrase**. "I confirm, it's indeed a problem" is useless. "I confirm, and here's additional data that worsens the observation" is useful.
- **Direct tone**. Experts are not diplomats with each other. Peers without time to waste.

### Format Phase 2

```
── Cross-talk ──

[Expert N — Role] → [reaction type] [Expert M — Role]
"[Reaction in 2-3 sentences max — direct, no politeness]"

[...]
```

---

## Phase 3 — Chairman verdict

You resume the Chairman role. You synthesize AND you rule. The Chairman is not a secretary, they are a decider.

### 1. Strong signals (convergences)

Problems raised by 2+ experts from different angles. These are absolute priorities. For each strong signal, explain in one sentence why multi-angle convergence makes this point more critical than a single-expert issue.

### 2. Tension points

Disagreements between experts. Present both sides and rule: give your opinion on who is probably right, why, and in what context the other would be right. **The Chairman does not stay neutral, they arbitrate.**

### 3. Final verdict — "What to do Mvitatone morning"

Ranking of max 5 priority actions, ordered by severity:

| # | Severity | Issue | Raised by | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 🔴 Critical | ... | Expert 1, 3 | ... |
| 2 | 🟠 Important | ... | Expert 2 | ... |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

Each recommended action **YOU MUST** answer: *"What do I concretely do Mvitatone morning?"*
- Who does what (person or role)
- How long (hours, days, weeks)
- Expected measurable outcome
- Estimated cost/effort

**NEVER** "we should consider..." → action verbs: "Create...", "Test...", "Remove...", "Measure...".

### 4. What was NOT flagged

One sentence on what the panel didn't find problematic (reassure the operator on what holds). Max 2-3 sentences. **NEVER** a disguised compliment paragraph.

---

## Phase 4 — Archive + propagate (automatic)

After the operator sees the verdict:

1. **Archive the audit** at `brands/{slug}/audits/YYYY-MM-DD-redteam-{subject-slug}.md` (create folder if needed). If no brand context (meta-audit like this one on PhantomOS itself), archive at `docs/audits/`. Include: subject audited, panel composition, Phase 1-2-3 output in full, amplifiers used.

2. **Trigger `capture-learning` automatically** on any Phase 1 issue with **confidence ≥ 8**. These are hard-data findings, they belong in `learnings.json` with `reasoning` field = the expert's rationale. Pattern: `{fact: issue.what, reasoning: "Red-team expert {role}/{prism}: {why-it-matters}", scope: "brand" or "system", confidence: X/10}`.

3. **Append critical verdict items (🔴)** to `brands/{slug}/pending-validations.md` under "Skill candidates / Critical actions from audits". **NEVER** modify existing items, append-only.

4. **Close with offer**: *"Want me to dig deeper on one point? Or a second round from a specific angle?"*. Use `AskUserQuestion`.

---

## Output modes

### Mode "Full debate" (default)

Show Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 + Phase 4 integrally. The operator sees the full reasoning of each expert and the exchanges. Longer, but transparent and educational.

### Mode "Condensed verdict"

**NEVER** show panel composition, Phase 1, or Phase 2. Produce directly Phase 3 (Chairman verdict) integrating Phase 1-2 insights in internal reasoning. Result must be short (max ~500 words), direct, actionable. Start directly with strong signals. No preamble, no context recap. Mode for operators in a hurry who just want to know what to do.

By default propose "Full debate" as it gives more value. But always offer the choice.

---

## Optional amplifiers

If the operator adds one of these modifiers, adapt panel behavior:

- **"beginner traps only"** → experts focus on errors obvious to experts but invisible to novices
- **"macro first"** → all experts start with fundamentals (structure, intent, coherence) before any detail
- **"pre-mortem" / "what would make this fail?"** → orient whole panel toward failure modes. Each expert writes as if drafting the project's post-mortem one year after failure: "Here's what went wrong, the signals we ignored, the decisions that seemed reasonable at the time." More revealing than a risk list because it forces causal narration of failures. Phases 1-2-3 format unchanged.
- **"no mercy"** → remove all diplomacy, maximize frankness. Chairman also becomes direct. **CRITICAL**: "no mercy" = direct and cutting, not contemptuous. Critique the work, never the person. Brutality must be surgical and useful, not gratuitous.
- **"steelman then kill"** → each expert starts by formulating the best possible version of the project's argument (steelman), then explains why even this optimal version has flaws. Produces more credible critiques because they cannot be dismissed as "you didn't understand the concept".

---

## Guardrails

- **NEVER** produce an empty audit. If the project is solid, say so but still find improvement angles. No project is perfect.
- **NEVER** invent problems to fill space. If an expert has only 1-2 issues instead of 3, that's OK.
- If the project is very short or simple, reduce panel to 3-4 experts instead of 5-6. Adapt size to subject.
- If the subject is a PhantomOS skill itself (`build-agent`, any SKILL.md) → include at least one "PhantomOS architect" expert in the panel.
- Panel stays within Claude Code single context in V1. V2 option: spawn each expert as a real subagent via Task tool for fresh context per expert (reduces convergence bias). Flagged as future upgrade, not default.

## Emoji policy

🔴 🟠 🟡 (severity indicators) and 🔗 ⚡ ➕ 💡 (cross-talk reaction types) are **functional signals, not decorative**. These are allowed per PhantomOS rule "one-off signaling for technical state is OK". No other decorative emoji anywhere.
